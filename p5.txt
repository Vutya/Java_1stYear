for
xxxjonny

and

and
all

xxxarlingtonians
for
tea
sympathy
and
a
sofa
far
out
in
the
uncharted
backwaters
of
the
unfashionable
end
of
the
western
spiral
arm
of
the
galaxy
lies
a
small
unregarded
yellow
sun
orbiting
this
at
a
distance
of
roughly
ninety
two
million
miles
is
an
utterly
insignificant
little
blue
green
planet
whose
ape
descended
life
forms
are
so
amazingly
primitive
that
they
still
think
digital
watches
are
a
pretty
neat
idea
this
planet
has
or
rather
had
a
problem
which
was
this
most
of
the
people
on
it
were
unhappy
for
pretty
much
of
the
time
many
solutions
were
suggested
for
this
problem
but
most
of
these
were
largely
concerned
with
the
movements
of
small
green
pieces
of
paper
which
is
odd
because
on
the
whole
it
wasn
t
the
small
green
pieces
of
paper
that
were
unhappy
and
so
the
problem
remained
lots
of
the
people
were
mean
and
most
of
them
were
miserable
even
the
ones
with
digital
watches
many
were
increasingly
of
the
opinion
that
they
d
all
made
a
big
mistake
in
coming
down
from
the
trees
in
the
first
place
and
some
said
that
even
the
trees
had
been
a
bad
move
and
that
no
one
should
ever
have
left
the
oceans
